BLOXORZ
-------

This game involves rolling a block along tiles and eventually guiding it into a hole without falling off the map.

MOVEMENT
--------
When the block is upright, moving it in any direction makes it fall in that direction.
When the block is horizontal, moving it along its longer side makes it vertical and moving it along its shorter side makes it roll in that direction, keeping it horizontal.

TILES
-----
There are 4 kinds of tiles:

1. Normal tiles - These are GREY in color and are the basic tiles.
2. Fragile tiles - These are ORANGE in color. The block can only be horizontal on these tiles. Vertical
					block will make it collapse and the block will fall through.
3. Switches - They are RED in color. When the block is upright on them, they toggle. When they are ON, 				they activate their corresponding bridge. When they are OFF, the bridge disappears.
4. Bridges - They are GREEN in color. They are activated by switches. When active, they behave like
			 normal tiles.

CAMERA VIEWS 
------------
Tower view - The map is viewed as if the camera is on top of a tower adjacent to the map.
Top-Down view - The map is viewed as if the camera is vertically above it.
Block view - The map is viewed as if the camera is within the block.
Follow-cam - The camera is always behind the block.
Helicopter view - The camera is in a helicopter that is circling the map at a height. Height of the helicopter can also be reduced. 

RULES
-----
The block has to stay on the map. Else, it falls off and the level restarts.

GOAL
----
The goal is to make the block fall into the goal using minimum moves and time.
